This file was created half of November 1996
The order is not the order of the work.
I am going to work on them as I feel like.
If somebody wants to help, please contact me.

1) Solve CD Playing to DART/RTMMM problems 
*- problem found : MUSIC DISKs are read at 44080 Hz !!!! <<44100 of DART
*- they are read as 1x
*- A data disk is read correctly at 4X . A data disk can be played much 
*- faster. Thus I have adjusted the rate of playing of the RTMMM and DART
*- by 50Hz. No other application will notice it bu the actual data requests
*- are now less frequent!
*- This behaviour seems to be CD player dependant.
*- I must find a way of improving that.
2) Investigate clicks on CD data
*- Maybe they are cured now??
3) Add more File types
*- WAV supported only output
4) Work on Maplay3
5) Work on the BitStream
6) Work on the Ampeg 2 Encoder:
-  Put data files into code
-  Support direct from CD compression
7) Write a Wav player.
8) Write an AudioInputStream Class
- Support AD input
- Support file input
- Support CD input
- Support directo to AudioStream playback
9) Work on RTMMM exstension
- Extra Audio outputs:
-- level meter
-- secondary monitor DA board ( very tough )
-- interface for multiple output clients
- Filters in the ouput stadium : reverber filter etc
with user defined parameters: allow graphical equalizer
being written
- Better interpolating filter for lower sampling rates.
- Assembler ??
- Optimization ??
10) PIPE interface for maplay
- Allow grafical user interface and automatizing REXX scripts
11) PIPE interface for rtmmmcd
- Allow grafical user interface and automatizing REXX scripts
12) Write a MIDI player (HELP)
13) Multiple Control programs interface for RTMMM
